## Java Modules
All Java modules require **Java 11** to compile and run.

### Building with Gradle

Each module should be an independent build and can be built by calling `./gradlew clean build` in the module directory. 

All modules are listed in [build-all.sh](build-all.sh) to run in the CI pipeline.

### Non-Java Modules

Some folders contain non-Java projects. For those, refer to the README within the module folder.
